Welcome to Amazon Sentiment Analysis Project

Task
The task of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard for sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. This involves acquiring a dataset of product reviews, preprocessing the data to ensure its quality, and conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights. The project also includes sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques and building and evaluating sentiment analysis models. Finally, the project culminates in the development of the interactive dashboard using Dash, allowing users to input reviews and visualize sentiment analysis results in real-time.
The challenge lies in effectively analyzing and categorizing the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral.

Description
This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze Amazon product reviews. It incorporates machine learning models to classify the sentiment of each review.

The sentiment analysis results are then visualized in an interactive dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications.
